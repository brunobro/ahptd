ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS (AHP) FOR TABULAR DATA

Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is the most used method to solve multi-criteria decision-making problems in the world. Although AHP has many advantages in a problem with several alternatives and criteria, pairwise comparisons require a lot of effort. State-of-the-art methodologies have shown that AHP is suitable for automating decisions on tabular data. With this in mind, was proposed a new approach to decision maker in an automatic and semi-automatic way. For the first type, formulas are proposed for normalization and calculation of criteria weights. For the second case, functions are proposed that convert normalized tabular data to values on the Saaty scale. These values are used to construct the pairwise comparison matrices. Thus, the presented approach allows the decision maker to generate matrices for the comparisons deems necessary. This minimizes (or even reduces) the effort of peer comparisons. Simulations show the differences obtained depending on the use of the conversion function for the Saaty scale. Comparisons with state methods reveal that the proposed approach is compatible with these approaches.
